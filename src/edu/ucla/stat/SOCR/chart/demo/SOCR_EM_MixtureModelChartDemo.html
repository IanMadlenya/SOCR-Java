<p>
This experiments demonstrates the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. 
			In this setting the EM is applied as a tool for classisfication.
			<ol>
			<li> Select random points in the 2D plane (manually by clicking the mouse in the 
			field of view or by clicking the <code>RandomPnts</code>button.
			<li>  Then select the number of cluster that you want to identify
			<li>  Click <code>InitKernels</code> to get a different starting condition (EM algorithm is VERY sensitive 
			to the starting conditions!)
			<li>  Select Normal/Fast/Slow spead of the algorithm (for demo purposes choose Slow)
			<li>  Choose Gaussian or Linear fit for your mixture model
			<li> Click <code>EM Run</code> to start the algorithm. Observe the evolution of the process (convergence is guaranteed!)
			<li>  Finally, use <code>EM Stop</code> or <code>EM 1 Step</code> to terminate the or take one step at a time
